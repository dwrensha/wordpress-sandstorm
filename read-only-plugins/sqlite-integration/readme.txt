SQLite Integration is the plugin that enables WordPress to use SQLite. If you want to build a WordPress website with it, this plugin is for you.

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to create WordPress based web sites without MySQL database server. All you've got to prepare is the Apache web server or the like and PHP with PDO extension. WordPress archive and this plugin in hand, you can build a WordPress web site out of the box.

SQLite Integration is a successor to [PDO for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pdo-for-wordpress) plugin, which unfortunately enough, doesn't seem to be maintained any more. SQLite Integration uses the basic idea and structures of that plugin and adds some utilities with more features.

= Features =

SQLite Integration is a database access engine program. So it's not like the other plugins. It must be used to install WordPress. Please read the install section. And see more detailed instruction in the [SQLite Integration Page](http://dogwood.skr.jp/wordpress/sqlite-integration/).

Once you succeed in installing WordPress, you can use it just like the other systems using MySQL. Optionally, this plugin provides the feature to temporarily change the database to MySQL and come back to SQLite, which may help developers test their sites on the local machines without MySQL.

After you finish installing, you can activate this plugin (this is optional but I recommend you to). And you can see some instructions and useful information on your server or your installed plugins.

= System Requirements =

* PHP 5.2 or newer with PDO extension (PHP 5.3 or newer is better).
* PDO SQLite driver must be loaded.

= Backward Compatibility =

If you are using 'PDO for WordPress', you can migrate your database to this plugin. Please check the install section.

= Support =

Please contact us with the methods below:

1. Post to [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/sqlite-integration/).
2. Visit the [SQLite Integration Page](http://dogwood.skr.jp/wordpress/sqlite-integration/)(in English) or [SQLite Integration(ja) Page](http://dogwood.skr.jp/wordpress/sqlite-integration-ja/)(in Japanese) and leave a message there.

= Notes about Support =

WordPress.org doesn't officially support using any other database than MySQL. So you will have no supports from WordPress.org. Even if you post to the general Forum, you'll have few chances to get the answer. And if you use patched plugins, you will have no support from the plugin author(s), eithter. I will help you as much as I can, but take your own risk, please.

= Translation =

Documentation is written in English. If you translate it into your language, please let me know.

* Japanese (kjmtsh)
* Spanish (Pablo Laguna)

== Installation ==

For more detailed instruction, please visit [SQLite Integration](http://dogwood.skr.jp/wordpress/sqlite-integration/).

= Preparation =

1. Download the latest WordPress archive and this plugin. And expand them on your machine.
2. Move sqlite-integration folder to wordpress/wp-content/plugins folder.
3. Copy db.php file in sqlite-integratin folder to wordpress/wp-content folder.
4. Rename wordpress/wp-config-sample.php to wordpress/wp-config.php.

= Basic settings =

Open wp-config.php and edit the section below:

* Authentication Unique keys and Salts
* WordPress Database Table prefix
* WordPress Localized Language

See also [Editing wp-config.php](http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php) in the Codex. Note that you don't have to write your database server, user name, user password or etc...

= Less than 5 minutes installation =

Upload everything (keeping the directory structure) to your server and access the wp-admin/install.php with your favorite browser, and WordPress installation process will begin. Enjoy your blogging!

= Optional settings =

You can change some default settings with the directives in wp-config.php.If you change the SQLite database file name (default is .ht.sqlite) to others, add the next line in your wp-config.php.

`define('DB_FILE', 'your_database_name');`

If you change the directory where the SQLite database is put, add the next line in your wp-config.php.

`define('DB_DIR', '/home/youraccount/database_directory/');`

You can change either of them or both of them.

= Use MySQL without uninstalling this plugins =

If you want to use MySQL, add the next line in your wp-config.php.

`define('USE_MYSQL', true);`

Of course, this is not enough. You must give your database server address, user name, passowrd or etc... in the same file. After you add that line and access your web site for the first time, WordPress installer will begin. Then you must finish setting MySQL database. As you know, data in the SQLite database is not automatically migrated to MySQL.

If you want to use SQLite again, change the line in wp-config.php as below or just remove this line.

`define('USE_MYSQL', false);`

= For PDO for WordPress users =

If you are using PDO for WordPress now, you can migrate your database to SQLite Integration. I recommend the way below. See more detailed instruction [SQLite Integration](http://dogwood.skr.jp/wordpress/sqlite-integration/).

1. Export your data from current database.
2. Install latest WordPress with SQLite Integration.
3. Import the old data.

If export or import fails for some reason, please visit our site and try another way described there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Database file is not created =

The reason of failure in creating directory or files is often that PHP is not allowed to craete them. Please check your server setting or ask the administrator.

= Such and such plugins can't be activated or doesn't seem to work properly =

Some of the plugins, especially cache plugins or database maintenace plugins, are not compatible with this plugin. Please activate SQLite Integration and see the known limitations section in this document or visit the [SQLite Integration](http://dogwood.skr.jp/wordpress/sqlite-integration/) for more detailed information.

= I don't want the admin menu and documentation =

Just deactivate the plugin, and you can remove them. Activation and deactivation affect only admin menu. If you want to remove all the plugin files, just delete it.

== Screenshots ==

1. System Information tells you your database status and installed plugins compatibility.

== Known Limitations ==

Many of the other plugins will work fine with this plugin. But there are some you can't use. Generally speaking, the plugins that manipulate database not with WordPress' APIs but with MySQL or MySQLi native drivers from PHP might cause the problem.

These are some examples:

You can't use these plugins because they create the same file that this plugin uses.

* W3 Total Cache
* DB Cache Reloaded Fix
* HyperDB

You may be able to use 'WP Super Cache' or 'Quick Cache' instead of them. I don't mean to recommend them and give no warranty at all.

You can't use these plugins, because they are using MySQL specific features that SQLite Integration can't emulate.

* Yet Another Related Posts
* Better Related Posts

You may be able to use 'WordPress Related Posts' or 'Related Posts' instead of them. Probably there are more, I'm afraid. If you find one, please let me know.

There are some among the incompatible plugins, which work fine by rewriting some codes. I give information about them and provide the patch files on [Plugins](http://dogwood.skr.jp/wordpress/plugins/).

This plugin doesn't support 'WP_PLUGIN_URL' constant.
